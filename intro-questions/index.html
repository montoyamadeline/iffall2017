			<li>One thing I hope to learn in this class is the specifics of web design. I have a blog and I often feel restrained by my lack of knowladge of web design and it would be nice to have more control over the look of my site!</li>
			<li>I've only coded in Python a little bit (and wasn't good) but I remember the planning process of design was very different vs. working in paper. Coding is a whole other language than the creative process and while they interlap often, I feel like my designing process will focus more on strategy of the code and less on my initial creative wants.</li>
			<li> <a href="http://honestlywtf.com/"> This is a style, travel, and culture blog I discovered a long time ago. I love the image heavy layout; it's clean but also visually pleasing. </a> </li>
			<li> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/"> Amazon communicates effectively by making sure lots of categories exist for their millions of products, as well as easy to understand buttons. </a></li>
			<li> <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/"> Pinterest combines the nice layout of the blog I mentioned with the easy and organized buttons of Amazon, making it aestheticlly pleasing while also easy to use and understand.</a></li>

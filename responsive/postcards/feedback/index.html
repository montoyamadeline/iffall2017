Overall, Jane did a great job of relating her font choices with her images, choosing very specific type and image treatment that was relevant to her quotes. Some of the images were slightly pixelated, which could easily be fixed when building her postcards with html. The third postcard we discussed more than the others, purely because of her choice to combine a Tom Ford quote with a still from his film Nocturnal Animals. I suggested choosing a quote from this movie, or changing the image to reflect Tomâ€™s fashion work that would go better with this particular quote. I also suggested for postcard 2, playing more with the color of the font. I think the contrast between the raw photo and the font choice works nicely considering the quote, and was very legible, but perhaps this could be pushed with color choice. I also reminded her to consider how some of the font shifts up or down, and to maybe make sure that all the font is on the same axis to make for a smoother transition.

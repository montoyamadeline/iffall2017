	<h2>Feedback from Katie</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
		Katie really liked the images and colors going on; for they were very 90's esque. However, she thought there were some visual elements that made the site design weaker. 
	<br>
		For example, she suggested being much more intentional with how I broke up the type, and how a white background made the website look slightly unfinished. 
		<br>
		For adding more pizazz, she suggested to think about what things could possibly flash and/or scroll.

	<h2>Feedback from James</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
		James's suggestions were similar to Katie's; mostly about fixing the<br> image to look more integrated with the webpage as well as including a more <br>organized typographic system. He also suggested including more information,<br> such as the album cover and copyright symbol. <br>
		He also suggested trying to distort the type, if this was within my ability.

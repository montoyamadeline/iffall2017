			<h1> Machu Piccu </h1>
			<h2> The Strokes </h2>
			<p> 
				<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
				<br />
				I'm putting your patience to the test
				<br />
				I'm putting your body on the line, for less
				<br />
				Didn't you know there was a choice?
				<br />
				It's never yours but someone else's voice
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />

				<strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
				<br />
				Sellin' your body to the street
				<br />
				Sending your girlfriend's to the night, for cheap
				<br />
				Wearing a jacket made of meat
				<br />
				Sealing a letter made with horse's feet
				<br />
				And now you've heard that
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />

				<strong>[Chorus 1]</strong>
				<br />
				Waves turn to grey
				<br />
				Life in the shade
				<br />
				A violent crime
				<br />
				And that's the USA
				<br />
				Platinum's on the rise
				<br />
				Playboys in the sky
				<br />
				I'm just trying' to find
				<br />
				A mountain I can climb

				<br />
				<br />
				<br />


				<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
				<br />
				I'm putting your patience to the test
				<br />
				I'm putting your body on the line, for less
				<br />
				Didn't you know there was a choice?
				<br />
				It's never yours but someone else's voice

				<br />
				<br />
				<br />

				<strong>[Chorus 2]</strong>
				<br />
				Blondes turn to grey
				<br />
				Life in the shade
				<br />
				A violent crime
				<br />
				And that's the USA
				<br />
				Porn's on the rise
				<br />
				Psycho's in disguise
				<br />
				I'm just trying' to find
				<br />
				A mountain I can climb

				<br />
				<br />
				<br />

				<strong>[Bridge]</strong>
				<br />
				Darling, ain't nobody gonna tell us
				<br />
				They're gonna be oh so jealous
				<br />
				We're gonna be oh so silent
				<br />
				They're gonna be stoned in silence
				<br />
				<br />
				<em>(I didn't want to ask you baby
				<br />
				I didn't want to have to ask anyone baby
				<br />
				Is anyone asking maybe
				<br />
				Can anyone hear me/this shit?)</em>

				<br />
				<br />	
				Why are you waiting beyond the door

				<br />
				<br />
				<br />

				<strong>[Chorus 3]</strong>
				<br />
				Life turns to dust
				<br />
				And rain turns to rust
				<br />
				Gossip is a truth
				<br />
				And money pays for the lies we trust
				<br />
				Your love is a surprise
				<br />
				Homeless saints are in disguise
				<br />
				I'm just tryin' to find
				<br />
				A nice place for you and I
				<br />

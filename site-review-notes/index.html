<h1>Notes for SJ</h1>

<p>
Really love the typographic choices and the simple, clean design of the site. I just have a few edits :
<br>
<br>
<br>

1. The images and text seem too small for the webpage itself 
<br>
2. Once you leave the homepage, there's no way to get back to it, so maybe add a button for that 
<br>
3. While I like the layout of the site, it's interactivity is pretty low; besides clicking on the small top icons you can't really so anything else, which combined with the miniamal content, may come across as unengaging.
